Title: Ooops! Server error &#9785;
Slug: 500
Status: hidden


Looks like the server got sick, stuck, frozen or somebody plugged it off from the wall socket! Just for your information, this error has a numeric code and its called **500**.


You know what? Why don't you try to reload the page (press F5 on your keyboard)?


Problem still insists? <a href="mailto:mavrakis.n@gmail.com">Email me</a>, let me know about it and get out of here (but please come back again -- the problem will be solved quickly)!
