Title: About

Greetings to all human beings! My name is Nick Mavrakis and what follows is a brief introduction about myself.

It all begun on the year 2000 when I was accepted as an undergraduate student at the [Technological Educational Institute (TEI) of Athens](http://www.teiath.gr/?lang=en) (Greece) for a
degree of [Electronic Engineer](http://www.ee.teiath.gr/?lang=en).
I completed the course in 4 years (that was a tough one!).

Next came my postgraduate studies at the School of Engineering and Design of [Brunel University](https://www.brunel.ac.uk/) (London) for the degree
of M.S Data Communication Systems. Nowadays, this course is discountinued. I completed the course in 1 year (a tough one too!).

After that I joined as a member, the research team of the [REWIND project](http://users.teiath.gr/kvoud/rewind-project/) which focused on one of the
most important concepts in wireless network infrastructure ([WiMAX](http://wimaxforum.org/) relay based beta network).

Meanwhile, the curiosity and passion were growing about the Web and the application architecture.
First, I started with a dead-simple-hello-world PHP web page with some ultra-basic CSS rules (JS? what's that?) but soon realized that this was not the language for me.
One day a [friend of mine](https://twitter.com/happyCoder_) told me about a course on [edx.org](https://www.edx.org/) that was about to start.
Boom! Instantly fell in love with this snake called Python. Not poisonous, just strong constriction.

As a hobbist, I am building websites with deadlines using the [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) Web framework and, of course, keep myself
informed about new techniques, tricks, technologies, concepts, strategies in the Web world.
